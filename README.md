# React-Adventure
A choose your own adventure style game, built with React.

The game can be played on my website at: https://www.tomdaviesdevelopment.com/adventure/

The game itself is not complete, but all the systems and react infrastructure is done. I started this project to practice and gain experience with React, which has been done.

I've posted the entire project here in its current state in case anybody wants to review it. I may come back and actually add the rest of the content in the future.
(Damn it Jim, I'm a developer, not a storyteller!)

It should be noted that I haven't gone through and optimised the build for all mobile devices. Because of the responsive scaling I've used it should at least be useable on all devices, but might look a bit weird on some mobile devices.
